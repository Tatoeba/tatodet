3730939	eng	So what exactly are we talking about here, Tom?
317624	eng	I'll try her out as a secretary.
7563783	eng	Mary was invited to the ball.
6705572	eng	You cannot order just one frog leg.
7442862	eng	Tom and Mary let me know they wouldn't do that.

7183659	eng	Sami doesn't think anything of it.

7371384	eng	This is what I came for.
6527038	eng	Tom and Mary are both quite strong, aren't they?

4015243	eng	Tom lives in a large house.
4472299	eng	The appliance is wonderfully simple to operate.
5152830	eng	He wants a banana.
6270831	eng	Tom told Mary not to be frightened.
6824110	eng	Let's meet at my office.
312821	eng	She waited for him for hours.
8198016	eng	Is an apple?

6524429	eng	I wonder whether or not Tom and Mary will get divorced.
6124879	eng	Tom won't let you guys help him.
7331426	eng	Fortunately, the sun came out.

7128611	eng	Why are you so obsessed with crystals?
6355588	eng	Tom and Mary are finally going to do that.
2264482	eng	Why does he always make allowances for her conduct?
3431148	eng	Tom isn't able to drive a car.
339428	eng	I still don't write Chinese well.
7270400	eng	Sami was asking how much everything cost.
3821086	eng	Tom was my roommate.
2062791	eng	Did you lose something?
8575321	eng	We're not ready to throw in the towel yet.
5366236	eng	Every house in our neighborhood is practically identical.

6274553	eng	You often do that.
5856427	eng	Tom's success motivated me.
5729006	eng	Nothing could be more misguided.
3953907	eng	How could things have happened this way?
8338410	eng	I don't work the same hours every day.
8597273	eng	I need strong screws and wall anchors to install this heavy towel rack.
4496417	eng	Things changed after that.
258455	eng	I make a point of writing an answer as soon as I get a letter.
799908	eng	I should have let you know sooner.
6049126	eng	What did Tom suggest we buy?
1490538	eng	When I opened my eyes, everyone began to sing "Happy Birthday".
327399	eng	I like this town as it is. Although, there being so many stone stairs is a bit of a pain...
2647921	eng	Tom isn't that old.
3998304	eng	Dan changed Linda's life.

3824564	eng	Tom said he didn't know anyone who could speak French.
819221	eng	A man's will is nothing when compared to that of the heavens.
247703	eng	Our train leaves at eight-thirty.
3907138	eng	You lied to him.
37136	eng	Tom is flush with money since he got paid today.
5006421	eng	It's now ready to use.
2936477	eng	I don't need favors.

7516444	eng	I know that you're not yourself today.
8297057	eng	I think everyone should see it.

708390	eng	This summer I went on vacation in Scotland.
6648141	eng	Tom said that he thought that you wouldn't win.
7444718	eng	They told me they liked swimming.

7489929	eng	What's your astrological sign?
6251368	eng	Tom is the only man on the committee.
8764705	eng	It was Berber class.

6253787	eng	I didn't have the guts to do that.
5916242	eng	Tom has a reputation for violence.
7988981	eng	Why would Tom want to hurt me?
6272328	eng	The lawn needs mowing.
8513648	eng	He's forgiven her.
6412010	eng	Mary still doesn't think Tom can do that, does she?
329398	eng	"Pet loss" refers to the reactions of shock and anger that occur in owners who have been bereaved of their pets.

6267096	eng	You play piano, don't you?
3928186	eng	Tom suspected that Mary came to the party to steal something.
3711993	eng	When I was little, I believed in Santa.
34760	eng	The teacher told me that Hitler killed himself.
3061289	eng	Tom is looking forward to seeing you again.
257265	eng	I've come to see the sights.
8824577	eng	She certainly could not be a day less than seventy now.
7299600	eng	Layla was putting on her lipstick.

7205642	eng	I need to be in Boston by the first of next month.

2268471	eng	The problem had to be faced.
6385619	eng	"Leave her alone." "Say that again, little fag?" "I'm gonna break your face."

56140	eng	I need a box of this size.
5168427	eng	I wish Tom had told us earlier.
3823967	eng	Tom didn't graduate from here.
6517186	eng	I hope Tom and Mary aren't desperate.
2298159	eng	She came home crying.
288121	eng	He has a dog.
7505261	eng	I know Tom didn't know that you didn't need to do that.
7266014	eng	Sami's audience was 60% women.
3415182	eng	Do I owe you money?
3916500	eng	I gave him Monday off.
1095687	eng	Tom came to Boston looking for work.

2315149	eng	I do what is required.
5198239	eng	The longer you wait to tell her, the worse it's going to be.
1408999	eng	I think she was planning to go visit her mother in the hospital.
5591582	eng	It shouldn't take too much longer.

1777440	eng	He politely corrected me.
5995350	eng	The Eurail pass allows for unlimited travel inside Europe.
7970119	eng	Sami brought a bottle of champagne.

7164534	eng	I returned to Australia on October 20th.
6236757	eng	You should've done that before you went home.
2642340	eng	Tom looked to Mary for guidance.
5871806	eng	Fadil's statement shed additional light on Layla's disappearance.
256013	eng	I shall will my money to a hospital.
5731775	eng	What's wrong with the picture?
35987	eng	Richard Nixon dropped from public attention.
6873506	eng	I'm being forced to do this.
8584094	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he just told us.
58031	eng	By whom was this window broken?
6910024	eng	Tom is out there, isn't he?

3726201	eng	Tom is pretty shaken up.
317891	eng	The defendant appealed against the sentence without hesitation.
3310817	eng	We're going to get you home.
2538038	eng	Tom told Mary that he had been out shopping.
